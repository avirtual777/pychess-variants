# ![Horde960](https://github.com/gbtami/pychess-variants/blob/master/static/icons/Horde960.svg) Horde 960

Horde 960 is a custom variant combining the rules of Horde with the random placement of Chess 960.

This variant can be played by checking the "Chess960" option when creating a Horde game.

## 960 Rules

The starting bottom ranks are randomized, but two rules must be followed:

* The bishops must be placed on opposite-color squares.
* The king must be placed on a square between the rooks.

All other rules are as in Horde.
